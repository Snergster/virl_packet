VIRL on Packet.net - Disclaimer
-------------------------------

Running costs:
--------------
When a VIRL server is brought up on the Packet platform, charging will commence. This includes the period where the VIRL software is being automatically installed and configured. The charging period will end when the VIRL server instance is terminated by the customer.

The customer is responsible for ensuring that they terminate their VIRL server instance in order to avoid unexpected charges.

If the customer forgets to terminate their instance, the customer is responsible for the settlement of any and all associated costs with Packet.net.

Neither Cisco nor Packet can be held accountable should the customer forget to terminate their server instance, and in so doing, incurring additional unexpected charges.

Please see https://www.packet.net/bare-metal/ for details of Packet's service fees.

Support:
--------

Issues relating to the operation of the server itself are to be directed to Packet.net via their online chat, knowledgebase, or via help@packet.net.  

Issues relating to the operation of VIRL on the server are to be directed to http://community.dev-innovate.com/c/virl.

There is no special support offering in respect to using VIRL on Packet's bare metal platform.

Security:
---------

Customers must understand that their VIRL server instance on Packet's bare metal platform is connected directly to the Internet. Therefore the necessary security precautions should be applied.

VIRL provides specific commands to enable default security profiles and to enable a more secure connection method using OpenVPN (https://openvpn.net/) to the VIRL server instance.

Whilst we have made every effort to secure the VIRL server instance, the customer assumes responsibility for the security of the VIRL server at all times.

Neither Cisco nor Packet can be held accountable for any breaches of security that may occur as a result of the customer's actions.
